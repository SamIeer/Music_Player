## 🎛️ Features Explained

### 🎵 Add Songs to Playlist
- Adds new songs via file dialog (`tkinter.filedialog.askopenfilename`)
- Stores the song title and path in the SQLite database (`songbase.py`)

### 🗃️ Database Management
- `songs` table with the following schema:

  | Column | Type    | Description                |
  |--------|---------|----------------------------|
  | id     | INTEGER | Primary key                |
  | title  | TEXT    | Display name of the song   |
  | path   | TEXT    | Full file path (unique)    |

- Prevents duplicate entries using `UNIQUE(path)`

### 🗂️ Persistent Playlist
- On app startup, `musicplayer.py` loads all songs from the database into the playlist

---

## 🛠️ Future Improvements

- 🔊 Volume control slider
- 🧹 Delete songs from playlist & database
- 🔍 Search filter for the song list
- 📜 Add song metadata (artist, album, etc.)
- 🎨 Custom themes or dark mode support
